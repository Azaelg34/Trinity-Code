Not that any other restaurant will knock the Hardware Grill off its perch as THE downtown place for corporate dining, special occasions, or simply to enjoy a dinner for two based on surprisingly well-priced small plates.
But last Friday’s dinner for four — at least the tenth time I’ve dined at executive chef/owner Larry Stewart’s fine restaurant — was not as effortlessly perfect as in years past.
The at-table service was excellent – the city’s top waiters have always gravitated to the Hardware Grill – but the front-of-house host did not offer to take our coats on a rainy night. That was left to our server as we were seated.
And some dishes, while good, were not of the sky-high standard that have earned the Hardware Grill so many awards and accolades over the years.
Prices have eased to the $15 to $20 range on the Hardware Grill’s many  “small plates”.  Two can now dine at what’s still the best “classic” restaurant in town for under $70.
The beef carpaccio, scallops, smoked salmon, foie gras and the Hardware Grill’s iconic sea bass were excellent as always.

But three dishes — the pork chop, risotto and lobster roll –  fell surprisingly short of Hardware Grill standards.
A member of our party groaned over the thought of force-fed geese, but could not resist the tender, butter-smooth goose liver pate. Each mouthful of foie gras had that Hardware Grill touch, thanks to the accompanying onion jam and a sour cherry sauce.
